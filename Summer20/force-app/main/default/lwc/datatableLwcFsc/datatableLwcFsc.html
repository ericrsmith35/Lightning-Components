04/01/20 -  Eric Smith -    Version 1.0
Features:   The only required paramters are the SObject collection of records and a list of field API names
            The field label and field type will default to what is defined in the object
            Numeric fields will display with the correct number of decimal places as defined in the object
            Lookup fields are supported and will display the referenced record's name field as a clickable link
            All columns are sortable, including lookups (by name)
            The selection column can be multi-select (Checkboxes), single-select (Radio Buttons), or hidden
            A collection of pre-selected rows can be passed into the component
            Inline editing is supported with changed values passed back to the flow
            Unlike the original datatable component, only the edited records will be passed back to the flow
            The maximum number of rows to display can be set by the user
            Optional attribute overrides are supported and can be specified by list, column # or by field name, including:
                Alignment               
                Editable
                Header Icon
                Header Label
                Initial Column Width
                Custom Cell Attributes including those with nested values {name: {name:value}}               
                Custom Type Attributes including those with nested values {name: {name:value}}
                Other Custom Column Attributes including those with nested values {name: {name:value}}
